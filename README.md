`server/` - folder where all go logic lives

`client/` - folder where frontend staff is landed

`client/dist` - folder that contains built frontend application (you need to serve ./dist/index.html)

### Things needed to clarify

    - favicon
    - app name
    - app logo
    - data structures
    - login to access app ?
